# Latex Samples

## Getting Started
Below is how to get started on Linux (should be very similar on Windows):  
Install [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive) and 
[TeXstudio](https://texstudio.org). On Linux Mint, you can install using the 
graphical `Software Manager`.  

TeX Live will introduce various commands to your computer including `tex` and 
`pdflatex`. The command `tlmgr --gui` can be used to manage individual packages.
**tlmgr** is short for **TeX Live Manager**.

## Examples
To manually compile a Tex document to PDF, use the command: 
`pdflatex document.tex`  

You can open a package manual with the command `texdoc packagename`
